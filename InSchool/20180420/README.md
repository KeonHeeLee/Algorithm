# Huffman Encoding Algorithm

```
In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type 
of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression.

## 1. Huffman encoding source code
 We have implemented the Huffman coding algorithm in Python code. The reason for this is to compress it into a binary file, which was determined that C or C++ or Python equivalent is more suitable for this purpose. Detailed source code can be found in the "src" directory.
 
- **[main.py](https://github.com/KeonHeeLee/Algorithm/blob/master/InSchool/20180420/src/main.py)** : main source source code
- **[compress.py](https://github.com/KeonHeeLee/Algorithm/blob/master/InSchool/20180420/src/compress.py)** : compressing source code
- **[decompress.py](https://github.com/KeonHeeLee/Algorithm/blob/master/InSchool/20180420/src/decompress.py)** : decompressing source code

## 2. Another compressing algorithms
- 7z, LZH, zip, xz, gz, tar(Actually, tar is not compressing algorithm.)
- I compared the data from the test cases with the algorithms presented above.

## 3. Compare Huffman & other algorithms
