# Huffman Encoding Algorithm

```
In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type 
of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression.

## 1. Huffman encoding source code
 We have implemented the Huffman coding algorithm in Python code. The reason for this is to compress it into a binary file, which was determined that C or C++ or Python equivalent is more suitable for this purpose. Detailed source code can be found in the "src" directory.
