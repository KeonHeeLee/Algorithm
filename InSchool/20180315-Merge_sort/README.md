# A comparison of merge sort with selection sort

## Selection sort
- Time complexity(average) : O(n^2)
  - input::n * input::n = O(n*n)
- Space complexity : O(1)

## Merge sort
- Time complexity(average) : O(n log n)
  - input::n * floor::log n = O(n*log n)
- Space complexity : O(n)
  - This is because the merge sort allocates as much space as the number of inputs in the 'Divide and Conquer' phase.
